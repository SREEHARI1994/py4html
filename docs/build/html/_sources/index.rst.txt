py4html official documentation
==============================

What is py4html??
-----------------

In simplest words, py4html is a python library that makes to possible to develop a website or
web app without having to learn and type a single word of html,css,javascript

That's a very bold claim and while it is true that complex or large web sites or apps without using
these languages can only be made using the more advanced Python web library under development,
it is absolutely true that py4html can be completely used to develop less complicated
sites/apps entirely using Python. This makes it a must need tool for students or begginers or hobbyists
who have just entered the world of programming via Python and is very hesistant to start learning
the much more difficult to understand standard 3 web languages mentioned above.

It should however be noted that py4html is just an html code generator and is not intended as a replacement
of html css. Instead all you do is open a python file, import from py4html and type a bunch of very easy to 
understand python code and then upon running this dummy python program which can be deleted later after use, 
you will get an index.html file created and saved in the same directory as your python code, which upon 
opeing in the browser,Hurray!! you will realise that, it is exactly the web page that you had in your mind.
