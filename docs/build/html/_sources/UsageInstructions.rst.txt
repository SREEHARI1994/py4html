Instructions:Must Read
======================

Traditionally while developing web pages using html, a top down approach is followed where the first html tag
will be for the top most portion of the web page, then the next tag on the next line of the html file wil be
for defining how the portion just below the top most portion looks and so on. So we start of at the top 
left corner of our browser and then go down to as long as we want as the browser allows for scrolling.In other
words, while writing html files, we don't have to worry about how the top most left portion looks, then the 
top most central portion, then the top most right portion and so on. Instead when we start of with <h1> tag,
heading text appears at the top of our web page and then when we add a <p> tag in the next line,text in the 
<p> tag appears as a pargraph(wrapped to the size of browser window) just below our heading. **py4html follows
the exact same approach by calling one function for what we want at topmost in first line followed by the 
function call for what we want below that in the next line and so on.**
